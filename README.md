# 3D-Model-of-the-Solar-System-Using-Plotly-in-Python

 I am using a combination of Plotly Scatter3D and Plotly Surface plots to create an entire Solar system inside one graph.
 
 ðŸ‘‰ Plotly Scatter3D for drawing orbits and Plotly Surface for drawing spheres which would replace markers to make up our planets.
 
 In this model we create four function that perform some tasks :- 
 
 1) A function that will do the job of creating spheres
 2) A function that will draw orbits as well as rings around Saturn
 3) A function for Annotations
 4) A main function for drawing the solar system
